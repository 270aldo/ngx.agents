# NGX Agents Project Summary

## Project Overview
NGX Agents is a sophisticated system of specialized agents for fitness, nutrition, and wellness coaching that implements a Google ADK-based Agent-to-Agent (A2A) architecture. The system provides personalized assistance through multiple domain-specific agents that communicate with each other via an optimized A2A server.

## Core Components

### Agent Architecture
- **Orchestrator**: Central agent that analyzes user intentions and coordinates specialized agents
- **Elite Training Strategist**: Designs and adapts training programs
- **Precision Nutrition Architect**: Creates personalized nutrition plans
- **Biometrics Insight Engine**: Analyzes biometric data for health insights
- **Motivation Behavior Coach**: Provides motivation and behavioral guidance
- **Progress Tracker**: Monitors and reports user progress
- **Recovery Corrective**: Specializes in recovery techniques and injury prevention
- **Security Compliance Guardian**: Ensures data security and regulatory compliance
- **Systems Integration Ops**: Manages external system integrations
- **Biohacking Innovator**: Explores cutting-edge wellness techniques
- **Client Success Liaison**: Manages client relationships and satisfaction

### Core Infrastructure
- **A2A Server**: Optimized message broker for inter-agent communication
- **State Manager**: Distributed system for managing conversation state
- **Intent Analyzer**: Analyzes user intentions using embeddings and semantic models
- **Vertex AI Client**: Centralized client for Google Vertex AI services
- **Telemetry**: System for monitoring and tracking performance metrics

## Current Status

The project is in an active optimization and migration phase. Several key components are being refactored and enhanced for improved performance, reliability, and scalability.
