# NGX Agents Project Brief

## Project Overview
NGX Agents is a sophisticated system of specialized agents for fitness, nutrition, and wellness coaching that implements a Google ADK-based Agent-to-Agent (A2A) architecture. The system provides personalized assistance through multiple domain-specific agents that communicate with each other via an optimized A2A server.

## Core Objectives
1. Deliver personalized, AI-powered coaching for fitness, nutrition, and wellness
2. Implement a resilient, scalable Agent-to-Agent architecture
3. Optimize communication between specialized agents
4. Ensure high performance, security, and compliance
5. Provide multimodal capabilities for analyzing images, voice, and documents

## Key Components

### Agent Architecture
- **Orchestrator**: Central agent that analyzes user intentions and coordinates specialized agents
- **Elite Training Strategist**: Designs and adapts training programs
- **Precision Nutrition Architect**: Creates personalized nutrition plans
- **Biometrics Insight Engine**: Analyzes biometric data for health insights
- **Motivation Behavior Coach**: Provides motivation and behavioral guidance
- **Progress Tracker**: Monitors and reports user progress
- **Recovery Corrective**: Specializes in recovery techniques and injury prevention
- **Security Compliance Guardian**: Ensures data security and regulatory compliance
- **Systems Integration Ops**: Manages external system integrations
- **Biohacking Innovator**: Explores cutting-edge wellness techniques
- **Client Success Liaison**: Manages client relationships and satisfaction

### Core Infrastructure
- **A2A Server**: Optimized message broker for inter-agent communication
- **State Manager**: Distribued system for managing conversation state
- **Intent Analyzer**: Analyzes user intentions using embeddings and semantic models
- **Vertex AI Client**: Centralized client for Google Vertex AI services

## Current Focus
The project is undergoing a significant optimization phase with several key migrations in progress:
1. Migration to an optimized A2A server
2. Optimization of the Vertex AI client
3. Enhancement of the State Manager
4. Improvement of the Intent Analyzer
5. Implementation of advanced multimodal processing capabilities

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in response latency by 30%
- Increase in throughput by 50%
- Improvement in recommendation relevance by 40%
- Cost reduction in API usage by 35%
- Enhanced multimodal processing capabilities
